# Gradient Clock

**WebGL and Web Audio API splash page for [POMO], Milan**

Gradient Clock is a GLSL clock where hours, minutes and seconds are represented by colors (RGB). The colors spin around the center like pointers of an analog clock, gradients arise on the intersections of the pointers. The time is interactive and can be manipulated with mouse or touch events (drag and drop). It can decelerate until it runs backwards. Desktop browsers feature a high quality ticking sound that is in sync with the speed of the clock. Typographic numbers support readability.
